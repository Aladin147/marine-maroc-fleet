## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
1. **GPS accuracy issues**
   - Mitigation: Use Google Maps + OSRM, test in Morocco
   
2. **Offline sync conflicts**
   - Mitigation: Fleetbase handles this, extensive testing

3. **Battery drain**
   - Mitigation: Adaptive polling, background optimization

### Business Risks:
1. **Scope creep**
   - Mitigation: Fixed MVP scope, change requests quoted separately

2. **Pilot failure**
   - Mitigation: 2-week pilot before full rollout, money-back guarantee

3. **Driver resistance**
   - Mitigation: Simple UI, French language, hands-on training

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this scope
2. Create detailed technical specification
3. Set up development environment
4. Begin Week 1: Foundation phase
